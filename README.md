BDM Capstone Project | IIT Madras BS Degree

Author: Udghosh Rao

# Project Overview

This project analyzes payment behavior, cash-flow risk, customer reliability, and rental generator performance for Power Tech Project Associates, a generator sales & rental business in Neemrana, Rajasthan.

Using primary data collected directly from the business (50 transactions, Jan–May 2025), the study identifies:

Major delays in payment collection

Cash-flow risks due to long pending dues

High dependency on 5 customers

Underutilization of rental generators

Strong correlation between high-value sales & delayed payments

This project applies descriptive analytics, risk profiling, and performance evaluation to provide clear business recommendations.

# Business Problem

Power Tech Project Associates faces three critical challenges:

Unpredictable payment delays causing cash-flow instability

Low rental utilization, leaving assets idle

Revenue concentration risk, due to dependency on few customers

These issues were validated through video interviews, field visits, photographs, and official authorization documents (see Final Report)
